                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Sacha Brienesse, and I am a year 1 CreaTe student.</p>
                <p>I have a passion for web development, design and anything creative.</p>
                <p>I enjoy coding in my free time, playing videogames, drawing, painting and playing guitar.</p>
                <p>I am very involved in the student life, participating in various associations and committees.</p>
                <p>For example, I am a member of ESA Blueshell, ASV Taste and SV Proto where I am a part of several committees.</p>
                <p>I am in an esports team as well which you can find here!: <a href="https://esa-blueshell.nl/esports/valorant">BS G.G.C Yaptown</a></p>

                <h3>My work experience</h3>
                <p>I have worked for an ecommerce company called Gamp ebiz, where I was a warehouse employee.</p>
                <p>The skills I gathered from this are efficient handling when working with orders, processing orders, order picking and inventory control.</p>
                <p>I also did a half year student job at Nedap NV, where I worked as a service desk employee.</p>
                <p>Here I learned to work with customers, solve problems and multitask. I also learned how MS Azure works and how to troubleshoot common issues.</p>
                <p>Currently I am working at StudentKelner, mainly for FC Twente but also for other clients such as ODR.</p>
                <p>Here I learned how a POS System works, how to tap beers and serve customers.</p>
