                <h3>My work experience</h3>
                <p>I have worked for an ecommerce company called Gamp ebiz, where I was a warehouse employee.</p>
                <p>The skills I gathered from this are efficient handling when working with orders, processing orders, order picking and inventory control.</p>
                <p>I also did a half year student job at Nedap NV, where I worked as a service desk employee.</p>
                <p>Here I learned to work with customers, solve problems and multitask. I also learned how MS Azure works and how to troubleshoot common issues.</p>
                <p>Currently I am working at StudentKelner, mainly for FC Twente but also for other clients such as ODR.</p>
                <p>Here I learned how a POS System works, how to tap beers and serve customers.</p>
