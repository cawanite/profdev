								<h3>About this project</h3>
								<p>This was our first project of the module, we had to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator to create a poster that effectively communicates a behavior change message.</p>
                                <p>I have worked with Adobe programs before but I have never worked with Illustrator so that was a nice challenge for me.</p>
                                <p>I gotta be honest, I would rather use Photoshop for this kind of work. Since it's way easier and more intuitive for me.</p>
                                <p>For this project I was trying to make a poster about the effects of a gaming addiction.</p>
                                <p>The effects that this poster tries to communicate is an addiction to gaming and energy drinks to compensate for lack of sleep.</p>
                                <p>Some would suggest the message is "Choose your game time wisely." and others would not agree.</p>
