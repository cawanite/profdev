# My Digital Portfolio

This is a static website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is ready to be published with GitHub Pages.

Quick steps to publish on GitHub Pages are in the README below (also shown in the editor):

1. Initialize a local git repo and commit your files.
2. Create a repository on GitHub (either via the website or `gh` CLI) and add it as the remote.
3. Push your `main` branch to GitHub.
4. In the repository Settings â†’ Pages, select the `main` branch and the root (`/`) as the source.
5. Wait a few minutes and visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (or `https://<your-username>.github.io/` if your repository is named `your-username.github.io`).

Notes:
- A `.nojekyll` file is included to prevent GitHub Pages from running Jekyll (useful if you have files or folders starting with an underscore).
- If you plan to use a custom domain, create a `CNAME` file with your domain name and configure DNS records.

If you'd like, I can generate the exact PowerShell commands for your repository name and show how to use the `gh` CLI to create the repo and enable Pages.
